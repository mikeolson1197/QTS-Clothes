When pushing out my QTS Clothes, I needed a way to build a following. I thought my content was good enough, all I needed was an audience to see it. I went to Instagram, uploaded my designs and started to follow people. Selenium helped with this process. I could follow people faster, write comments, you name it. I never used this in an unsupervised way or with a bad intent. It was just to write fun code. I think it worked pretty well. The moral of the QTS story is that in order to be successful and actually create a following you need a little but of luck and amazing content.
